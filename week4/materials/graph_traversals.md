# Graph traversals

Here we will study different ways of visiting the vertices of a graph following their
relations. This will be useful when we are designing algorithms that work with
the data in the graph and require following a strict pattern when visiting the vertices.

## Breadth-First Search

[BFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search) is a graph traversal
algorithm that explores the neighbor vertices first, before moving to the next level
neighbors.

## Depth-First Search

[DFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search) is a graph traversal
algorithm that visits all vertices down a branch and then backtracks to neighbors.
